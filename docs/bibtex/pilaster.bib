  abstract = {In this paper, we present Pilaster (https://visusal.github.io/pilaster/), a collection of citation metadata extracted from publi-cations in visualization for the digital humanities. The collection isgenerated from a seed set of relevant publications from which we ex-tracted cited works, including journal and conference papers, books,theses, or blog posts, among other resources. The main aim of thiswork revolves around three main points:  first, the collection mayserve as anentry pointto the discipline for digital humanists andvisualization scholars without previous experience in the field. Sec-ond, Pilaster can be regarded as ameeting pointfor more establishedvisualization or humanities scholars seeking to collaborate in thedevelopment of novel research ideas and related visualization designstudies in the context of the humanities. Third, and given the largeamount of visualization design spaces that were captured, we believethe dataset has the potential to become thestarting pointfor futurestudies aimed at understanding the particularities of problem-driven visualization research in this and other contexts.},
